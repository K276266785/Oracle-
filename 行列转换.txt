1.创建表：
create table test(id int,name varchar(20),quarter int,profile int))

insert into test values(1,'a',1,1000);
insert into test values(1,'a',2,1000);
insert into test values(1,'a',3,1000);
insert into test values(1,'a',4,1000);
insert into test values(2,'a',1,1000);
insert into test values(2,'a',2,1000);
insert into test values(2,'a',3,1000);
insert into test values(2,'a',4,1000);


2. Pivot 用法
select id,name,[1] as '1th Season',[2] as '2th Season',[3] as '3th Season',[4] as '4th Season'
from test
pivot
(
sum(profile)
for quarter in ([1],[2],[3],[4])
)as pvt

select * from test


3.Unpivot
select * from test2
select id,name,quarters,profiles
from test2
unpivot
(
profiles
for quarters in ([Q1],[Q2],[Q3],[Q4])
)
as unpvt


4.按数量拆分行
create table tmp_kai_test1(
       tc_code varchar2(100),
       tc_qty number);

select rowid,t.* from tmp_kai_test1 t

--method1
with tb2 as
 (select rownum rn
    from (select max(abs(tc_qty)) as maxlevel from tmp_kai_test1)
  connect by 1 = 1
         and level <= maxlevel)
select tb1.tc_code, 1*sign(tb1.tc_qty) as tc_new_qty
  from tmp_kai_test1 tb1, tb2
 where abs(tb1.tc_qty) >= rn
   and tb1.tc_qty<>0
 order by tb1.tc_code;

--method2
select tc_code, 1 * sign(tc_qty) as tc_new_qty
  from tmp_kai_test1
connect by tc_code = prior tc_code
       and level <= abs(tc_qty)
       and prior dbms_random.value is not null;
